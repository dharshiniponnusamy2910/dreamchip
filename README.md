# dreamchip
Adaptive RISC-V soft-core processor with a dual-ALU microarchitecture (1-cycle high-speed ALU + multi-cycle low-power ALU), a workload analyzer (lookahead, snooping, CPI), and a safe-switch control FSM. Includes synthesizable RTL, testbenches, instrumentation for toggle/CPI-based evaluation, and simulation results for an upcoming conference submission.
